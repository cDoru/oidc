# OpenId Connect Server

Uses open-source libraries to implement a security token service with OpenId Connect and OAuth2.



## Run in Dev environment

Create a settings file called appsettings.Development.json
For postgres, an example db connection string might be:

```
User ID=oidc;Password=supersecret;Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=oidc;Pooling=true
```

Start a postgres instance like so (or some other similar method):

```
docker run -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=wibble -p 5432:5432 --name oidc-postgres postgres
```

Create the user and database owned by the user:

```
./Scripts/init-db.sh
```

Run the dotnet app:

```
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development

dotnet run
```

Deploy to production

TODO: make this better

```
rsync -acz -e ssh ~/path/to/oidc/solution admin@<ec2instance.private_ip>:
```

then dotnet restore and build as before, and run:

```
export ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://*:5000"

dotnet run
```
